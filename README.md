## Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) Development
## Phase 1 - GitHub Administration
- Created & Configured my GitHub repository while i'm busy with the training.

## Phase 2 - Data Source: Configure Database
- I've begun with my API source control, and I've already loaded the local database.
- A secure service account username and password have been assigned to the SQL Server on Azure.
- The database on Azure SQL Server has been built, and the script with the necessary tables has been run.

## Phase 2 -Project Setup: API Project
- The ASP.NET Core Web API was created with the 3.1 Framework.
- Installed all the frameworks that were needed in order to run the application.
- Created the necessary Controllers. 
- The database was scaffold - which produces an Entity Framework model from an existing database by input my connection string from Azure.
- I have applied dependency injection that allows me to develop loosely-coupled code.
- Cloned my project to the GitHub repository.

## Phase 3 - Functionality 
- Created a new branch so that i can start developing my project and merging it to the main after big changes.
- Populated my categories controller.
