## Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) Development

## More about the Project
- Now we're more connected that ever, you can purchase anything by your fingertips from desktops, phones etc. But how does data get from here to there, how do devices and applications connect with each other to allow us to place an order make a reservation or book a flight with just a few things. That's where the Application Programming Interface (API) comes in, it is the engine under the hood and is behind the scenes that we take for granted but its what makes possible all the interactivity we've come to expect and rely upon. An API is the messenger that takes requests and tells a system what you want to do and then returnes the response back to you. To make it clearer 
## Phase 1 - GitHub Administration
- Created & Configured my GitHub repository while i'm busy with the training.

## Phase 2 - Data Source: Configure Database
- I've begun with my API source control, and I've already loaded the local database.
- A secure service account username and password have been assigned to the SQL Server on Azure.
- The database on Azure SQL Server has been built, and the script with the necessary tables has been run.

## Phase 2 -Project Setup: API Project
- The ASP.NET Core Web API was created with the 3.1 Framework.
- Installed all the frameworks that were needed in order to run the application.
- Created the necessary Controllers. 
- The database was scaffold - which produces an Entity Framework model from an existing database by input my connection string from Azure.
- I have applied dependency injection that allows me to develop loosely-coupled code.
- Cloned my project to the GitHub repository.

## Phase 3 - Functionality
- Created a new branch so that i can start developing my project and merging it to the main after big changes.
- When i created the Category Controller, i have made one that has actions, using Framework Entity. 
- It already has most of the methods (GET, POST, DELETE etc.)
- After that i created a pushed to my develop branch, and made a pull request to grab the changes that i have made. 
- Seeing that everything is working i created a merge request to my main branch.
- On this Project I am using GitHub Flow, when the code is working properly i create a pull request to the main.

### Methods
Representational State Transfer (REST) is a web service architecture approach. REST queries are sent through HTTP. They employ the same HTTP verbs that web browsers employ to get pages and transfer data to servers.
- GET: Retrieve all data from the database.
- GET: Retrieve data from the database based on the ID entered.
- POST: Create a new item of data on the database.
- PATCH: Update an existing item of data on the database.
- DELETE: Delete an item of data on the database.
