## Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) Development
## Phase 1 - Configure Database
- I've begun with my API source control, and I've already loaded the local database.
- A secure service account username and password have been assigned to the SQL Server on Azure.
- The databaseÂ on Azure SQL Server has been built, and the script with the necessary tables has been run.

## Phase 2 - API Configuration
- The ASP.NET Core Web API was created with the 3.1 Framework.
- The database was scaffold - which produces an Entity Framework model from an existing database by input my connection string from Azure.
- I have applied dependency injection that allows me to develop loosely-coupled code.
